SamuraiWTF (Web Training and Testing Framework) is a virtual machine, supported on VirtualBox and VMWare, that has been pre-configured to function as a web pen-testing and training environment. We have built the environment using Vagrant and Ansible to provide the easiest and most cross-platform mechanism to build and enhance the environment.

SamuraiWTF is built with one primary goal, Training. The environment contains a series of vulnerable applications and the tools necessary to learn how to assess various security risks.
