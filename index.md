SamuraiWTF (Web Training Framework) is not just another vulnerable application - it's a complete, robust framework for learning application security testing. It's a project of OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and is designed to help individuals boost their cyber security skills. The framework is based on an Ubuntu-based basebox, making it fairly lightweight and easy to manage.

SamuraiWTF is a build system made up of multiple projects.  It is best known for building a virtual machine that has been pre-configured to function as a web penetration testing and training environment. This environment is supported on Hyper-V, VirtualBox, and VMWare. It is built using Vagrant and Ansible to provide the most cross-platform mechanism to build and enhance the learning environment.
